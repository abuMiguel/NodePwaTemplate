This is a simple starting point for a complete, light-weight, progressive web app using NodeJS and the Pug template engine.

I designed this to be a fully self-contained app (db, services, and ui all in one, one repo, one deployment).

It doesn't include a front-end JavaScript framework. You can add your own if you need it, or go full vanilla. I added a minimal 
amount of dependencies and I think you will find this to be a very lean stack.

Using this template, you can just start creating your app and hopefully it is useful enough to save some people a lot of time.
I'm open to comments, suggestions, and feedback.

See the wiki for a list of features and more details about how to get started with the template.
